# Janet's Prototype 1 Design Document

## Name 
Woodland

## Type
Horror game, Game prototype

## Platform
Unity 2020.2.1F1 Windows

## DesignConcept
You find yourself in the deepest corner of an infinite forest, with nothing but a bottle of pills in your pocket. The forest seems to be unordinary, with creatures lurking in the shadows and mysteries to discover. What is this place? Who are you? How do you escape? Maybe you should take a pill to find out...

## Features
- First-person control (walking, running and taking pills)

- Boreal Forest Environment

- Horror Atmosphere

- Switch perspective to find clues (There is no goal in this prototype)



## Game Test Questions:

- What is your first impression of the game?

- Is there any confusion regarding how to control the game?

- Does the game atmosphere convey a sense of horror/mystery?

- Does the game mechanic of “switching perspective to find clues” work? If not, what can be changed/improved?

(The player is supposed to pick up the ball to end the prototype but the pickup is not currently working)

## Thank you for playing!

## Feedback from playtesting

- The controls were clear and the players have no problem using it.
- 
- The game conveys a sense of horror/mystery.
- 
- The game can be developped further to be a combination of story-driven horror game and puzzle game.
- 
- The game mechanic of "switching perspective to find clues" works, but it can be improved: 

1. The pill effect can intensify everytime the player takes a pill
2. The effect should last only a few secondes. Limited time frame to look at important items
3. The game should have a clearer visual indicator of how many pills you've taken or what your current state is

- Reported bugs:
- 
1. Some players don't see any changes after pressing E to take a pill
2. Deplays with the E key
