##DesignConcept
You find yourself in the deepest corner of an infinite forest, with nothing but a bottle of pills in your pocket. The forest seems to be unordinary, with creatures lurking in the shadows and mysteries to discover. What is this place? Who are you? How do you escape? Maybe you should take a pill to find out...

##Features
- First-person control (walking, running and taking pills)

- Boreal Forest Environment

- Horror Atmosphere

- Switch perspective to find clues


##Game Test Questions:

-What is your first impression of the game?

- Does the game atmosphere convey a sense of horror/mystery?

- Does the game mechanic of “switching perspective to find clues” work? If not, what can be changed/improved?

##Thank you for playing!
